### 1. What is call stack?
### 2. What's stored in a stack frame?
### 3. What is the role of the call stack?

### The key takeaways from the call stack are:
It is single-threaded, Meaning it can only do one thing at a time. 
Code execution is synchronous.
A function invocation creates a stack frame that occupies a temporary memory. 
It works as a LIFO â€” Last In, First Out data structure.
